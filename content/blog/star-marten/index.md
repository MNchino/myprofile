#### Description

In this 2D platformer, you control a marten, weaving your way through the solar system to stop the space dragon invasion.  Defeat enemies, collect stars, and power up to Galaxian form to make it to the star gate in one piece!

My contribution to this game was all of the programming and additional setup inside of the GameMaker Engine.  This project is a very complete game, approx up to 20 min. of gameplay, 7 levels, and save states included.
