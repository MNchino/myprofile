#### Description

This is a procedurally genearted dungeon crawler.  The player traverses a programmatically created dungeon, collects items, wards off enemies, and advances to the next floor.  

My work includes the research and development into the procedural AI programming, mapping generated floors to models in Unreal, and the player battle, progression, and overworld systems.
