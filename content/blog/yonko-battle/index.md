#### Description

This game is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game developed for mobile. Players are able to connect to a server and battle eachother over the internet.  Each player takes turns placing pieces on a 7x7 grid akin to traditional Four-In-A-Row.  However, players can further strategize by loading decks of pieces with special abilities, and filling their special meters with every three pieces lined up.  Characters are obtained in a gacha-like randomizer, with nearly 10 different ones to unlock.


My contribution to the game includes: The base gameplay infrastructure, networking, and UI mechanics.  Complicated features included managing player lobby states, disconnection, and handling a variety of requests from various actions.
