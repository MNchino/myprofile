#### Description

This game is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game developed for mobile. Players are able to connect to a server and battle eachother over the internet.  Players control a set of four characters across a checkerboard.  The objective is to capture the opponent's base.  Each player's characters additionally acquire items and powerups while traversing the board, and will have to fight opposing characters in order to advance.

My contribution to the game includes: The base gameplay infrastructure, networking, and UI mechanics.  The most difficult challenge was managing a 3D camera with 2D Assets.
