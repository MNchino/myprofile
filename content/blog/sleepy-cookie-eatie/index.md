#### Description

Pal wants to eat down a treasure of cookies!!  How long will the dream last? Why not find it out yourself!

This game is a traditional arcade-style game in which the player endlessly digs deeper and progresses to higher and higher levels.  It was a submission to the Ludum Dare 48 Game Jam, and the team collaborated overseas entirely online.

My contributions to the project included: level progression, central gameplay implementation, camera handling, and randomized generation.
