#### Description

**Full game name:** I Got Invited To A Demon Space Lord Birthday Party, But It's A Good Thing I Brought My Multi Combo Death Blaster

This is an entry for the IGDA Summer 2020 Game Jam.  It takes inspiration from titles like *Megaman X* creates a fast-paced shooter for players to navigate.  The game features a large scale combo-meter similar to bullet hell games in which the player becomes increasingly powerful the more he or she destroys.

My work on the game encompasses enemy mechanics, including the Boss sequence.
